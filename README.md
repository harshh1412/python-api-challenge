# python-api-challenge
Part 1:
 I have saved my work in the "WeatherPy" jupyter notebook file.
 The API keys used are saved in the "api_keys" python file which i have mentioned in the '.gitignore" file so that it does not get uploaded.
 The output csv file and the plot images are saved in the "output_data" folder.
